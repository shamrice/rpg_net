Command information:
--------------------
	Commands are sent over UDP from the client to the server on the server's IP or host name and port 
	specified in the server configuration. Commands must also include the server key to be acknowledged.
	Any commands that are sent that have improper syntax will be logged server side and ignored. The 
	client will not receive a response on bad data. 

Command structure:
------------------
	'|' and '|' are used to denote start and end of server key. 
	Server key: Key set by server at start up to know which requests are legitimate. (Think of as a password)
	command: command to be run.
	'>' is used to denote the end of the command name. '>' is used on requests. '<' is used on responses.
	'[' and ']' are used to denote the beginning and end of parameter section of the command.
	'{' and '}' are used to denote start and end of a key value pair parameter.
	key=value is the structure used inside of the key value pair brackets.
